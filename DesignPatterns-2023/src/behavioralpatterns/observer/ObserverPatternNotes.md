# Observer Pattern
Observer is a behavioral design pattern that lets you define a subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects about any events that happen to the object theyâ€™re observing.

The Observer pattern is useful for designing a consistent communication model between a set of dependent objects called **observers** and an object that they are dependent on **subjects** using **publish-subscribe** model.

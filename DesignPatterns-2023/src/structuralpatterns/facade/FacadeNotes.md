# Facade Pattern
It provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem.It defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.
It provides a simplified interface to a library, a framework or other complex set of classes.
It is a class that provides a simple interface to a complex subsystem.

In programming, facades can help to hide the ugly details of an implementation. It provides a simple interface or way to work with a family of classes or interfaces. The difference between **Facade** and **Absract Factory** is, the **Abstract Factory** design pattern focuses on creating related classes, while the **Facade** design pattern focuses on working with them once they have been created.

In the case of the Adapter design pattern, the goal is to make an otherwise **unusable** class **usable**. For the Facade design pattern, the goal is to make a complex group of classes **easy to use**.

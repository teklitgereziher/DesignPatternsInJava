# Design Patterns
History (late 1970s): The similarities between the different structures that were designed to solve the same problem that were of high quality is termed as a `pattern` or `architectural pattern`.
The patterns identified and documented were purely architectural and deal with structures like buildings, gardens and roadways.

A design pattern is a documented best practice or a solution that has
been applied successfully in multiple environments to solve a problem that recurs
in a specific set of situations.
In architectural pattern, Christopher Alexander describes a pattern as “a recurring solution to
a common problem in a given context and system of forces.”
- Context refers to the set of conditions/situations in which a given pattern is applicable
- System of forces refers to the set of constraints that occur in the specific context
